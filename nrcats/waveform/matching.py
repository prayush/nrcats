#: half cycle, but a smooth rising amplitude envelope does not reach one until
#: the merger, so applying it to |h| windows a fifth of the inspiral away
#: (measured: 633 of 3551 samples against 157 for the real part, and by

#:
#: A fixed-fraction window has none of those problems: it is deterministic
#: rather than data-dependent, it is *identical* for the two segments being
#: compared, and multiplying a complex array by a real window leaves the phase
#: untouched.
#:
#: **The taper is applied to the start only.**  Tapering the end is actively
#: harmful here.  These are NR and surrogate waveforms carrying a full merger
#: and ringdown, and a ringdown decays to zero on its own -- there is no
#: discontinuity at the end to suppress.  What an end taper does instead is
#: attenuate genuine merger-ringdown signal, which at M = 40 M_sun is where most
#: of the in-band signal-to-noise sits.  Only the start needs a window, because

    Same computation as :func:`compute_mode_match`, but it returns a

    lower cutoff** rather than return NaN when the requested band lies below
    what the common time window can resolve.

    Why the band is raised rather than the simulation discarded
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    The per-mode cutoff scales as ``|m|/2`` (see :func:`mode_f_lower`), which
    *lowers* the cutoff for ``m=1`` by a factor of two.  That mapping is
    physically correct but presumes the waveform extends to the lower
    frequency.  For a short waveform it does not: the integral then runs over a
    band where one input has no support, the normalisation degenerates, and
    ``pycbc.filter.match`` returns a bare NaN.  Measured, the transition sits at
    ``overlap * f_lower ≈ 1`` cycle.

    Discarding the simulation is the wrong remedy, because the failure is
    per-mode: at the duration where ``(2,1)`` fails, ``(2,2)``, ``(4,4)`` and
    ``(3,2)`` are still fine, and dropping the simulation throws those away
    too.  Raising the cutoff to the resolvable value instead reports the band
    that was *actually* integrated, and is close to value-neutral in practice
    because the detector PSD already suppresses the trimmed region.

    Parameters
    ----------
    h_nr, h_sur : pycbc.types.TimeSeries
        Complex NR and model mode time series, same ``delta_t``.
    f_lower_mode : float
        Requested low-frequency cutoff in Hz, normally ``mode_f_lower(f, m)``.
    psd : pycbc.types.FrequencySeries or None, optional
        A pre-built one-sided PSD.  It is **resampled** onto the frequency grid
        this function actually integrates on, so its ``delta_f`` need not match
        the padded segment -- the caller cannot generally know that resolution
        in advance, since it depends on the common window found here.  Outside
        the supplied range the PSD is taken as infinite, excluding those bins.
        When ``None`` (default) the PSD is built from ``psd_name``.
    psd_name : str, optional
        PyCBC analytic PSD name (default ``'aLIGOZeroDetHighPower'``).  Ignored
        when ``psd`` is given.
    f_upper : float or None, optional
        Upper frequency cutoff in Hz (default: Nyquist).
    min_cycles : float, optional
        Cycles at the band edge the window must contain
        (default :data:`MIN_CYCLES_AT_BAND_EDGE`).  Pass ``0`` to disable the
        raise and reproduce the historical behaviour exactly.
    alignment : str, optional
        Method to align waveforms before matching: 'peak' (default) finds
        the merger robustly from the end; 'crosscorr' uses a fast-FFT matched

    Thin wrapper over :func:`compute_mode_match_detailed` that returns only the

    Both inputs should be the *complex* strain mode, sampled at the same
    ``delta_t``.  The function pads to the next power-of-two, builds a PSD at
    the matching frequency resolution, and calls ``pycbc.filter.match()``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    h_nr : pycbc.types.TimeSeries
        Complex NR mode time series.
    h_sur : pycbc.types.TimeSeries
        Complex surrogate mode time series.
    f_lower_mode : float
        Low-frequency cutoff for this mode in Hz.
        Use ``f_lower * |m| / 2`` (GW frequency scales as |m| × f_orbital).
    psd : pycbc.types.FrequencySeries or None, optional
        Pre-built one-sided PSD, resampled onto the grid actually integrated.
        When ``None`` (default) it is built from ``psd_name``.
    psd_name : str, optional
        PyCBC analytic PSD name (default ``'aLIGOZeroDetHighPower'``).
    f_upper : float or None, optional
        Upper frequency cutoff in Hz (default: Nyquist).
    min_cycles : float, optional
        Cycles at the band edge the common window must contain before the
        cutoff is raised (default :data:`MIN_CYCLES_AT_BAND_EDGE`).  Pass ``0``
        to reproduce the historical behaviour exactly.
    alignment : str, optional
        Method used to align waveforms before matching. 'peak' (default) finds
        the merger peak robustly from the end; 'crosscorr' uses a fast-FFT
        matched filter over the full envelope to find the maximum phase coherence.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Match in [0, 1], or ``float('nan')`` if the mode carries no signal, the
        two waveforms do not overlap in time, or the band cannot be resolved.
        Use :func:`compute_mode_match_detailed` to tell those cases apart.

    Both inputs are the *complex* mode time series (h_lm = h+ - i h×), and both
    must be referenced to a common ``t = 0`` -- the (2,2) amplitude peak for
    every mode, which is what ``WaveformModes.get_mode()`` and the surrogate
    generator set.  The metric returned is::

        phase_diff_per_cycle = |ΔΦ_NR - ΔΦ_sur| / N_cycles_NR   [rad / cycle]

    with ``ΔΦ = |φ(t_end) - φ(t_start)|`` the net phase evolved over the window.
    The numerator is ``δφ(t_end) - δφ(t_start)``, the change in the phase
    difference across the window, so a constant offset -- a coalescence-phase
    convention -- cancels.  It is NOT the phase residual after match()-optimal
    time alignment.

    What this function got wrong until 2026-09-18
    ---------------------------------------------
    Note first that, since ``N_cycles_NR = ΔΦ_NR / 2π``, the metric is
    identically ``2π |1 - ΔΦ_sur/ΔΦ_NR|``: 2π times the *fractional* difference
    in accumulated phase, unbounded above, and divergent as the denominator
    goes to zero.  Two things then made the denominator wrong:

    1. ``N_cycles`` was taken from the *net* endpoint difference, which counts
       cycles only while the phase is monotone.  On ``RIT:eBBH:1132-n100-ecc``
       -- a single close encounter -- the net difference is 3.14 rad against a
       total variation of 96.9 rad, so ``N_cycles`` came out at 0.50, passing
       the old 0.5-cycle floor by a hair, and the metric reported 288 rad/cycle
       for an accumulated-phase ratio of 46.9.  The cycle count now comes from
       the total variation, which agrees with the net difference exactly for a
       monotone chirp (``SXS:BBH:2348``: 275.13 rad both ways) and differs by a
       factor of 30 where the phase wanders.
    2. The window was cut around each mode's *own* amplitude peak, found by
       :func:`_get_merger_index`, which takes the last prominent peak in order
       to step over junk radiation.  On a burst-like waveform the last
       prominent peak is late-time structure: for the same simulation it landed
       at t = +0.2373 s where the epoch puts the peak at 0.  The window is now
       the intersection of the two series *in time*, which is mode-independent
       and needs no peak search.

    ``alignment='peak'`` preserves the superseded behaviour, because
    ``compare_alignment_backends.py`` exists to compare these conventions and
    because it is what produced the phase columns of the frozen 2026-08 results.

    Parameters
    ----------
    h_nr, h_sur : pycbc.types.TimeSeries
        Complex NR and model mode time series, same ``delta_t``, both
        referenced to a common ``t = 0``.
    alignment : str, optional
        ``'epoch'`` (default) cuts the window from the epochs; ``'peak'`` from
        each series' own amplitude peak; ``'crosscorr'`` from the cross-
        correlation lag.
    min_cycles : float, optional
        Refuse to report a value below this many cycles in the window
        (default :data:`MIN_CYCLES_FOR_PHASE`).  Pass ``0`` to disable.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[float, float]
        ``(phase_diff_per_cycle, n_cycles_nr)``.  The value is ``nan`` when
        either waveform has zero norm, when the window holds fewer than two
        samples, or when it carries fewer than ``min_cycles`` cycles -- and in
        that last case ``n_cycles_nr`` is still returned, so the reason for the
        refusal is visible in the output rather than being another bare NaN.

    maximises over -- :math:`\alpha` multiplies :math:`h_+ - i h_\times` by a
    constant phase, which is a rotation of the polarisation basis by
    :math:`\alpha/2`.  :math:`\beta` is the one that per-mode matching cannot
    see: it rotates the source about the orbital angular momentum axis and is
    exactly degenerate with the azimuthal viewing angle, so it is unobservable
    and must be maximised over, but because it acts as :math:`e^{im\beta}` it is
    *not* absorbed by any single-mode phase maximisation.  Leaving it in place
    reports a mismatch dominated by a convention difference: measured at
    :math:`\iota = 60^\circ`, 5.7e-2 against 2.1e-4 for SXS:BBH:0201.

    Nothing else is maximised over.  Inclination is a physical parameter of the
    comparison, not a nuisance, so it is an argument rather than a search
    dimension; a mode set that only agrees at some fitted inclination is not the
    same waveform.

    Argument order and azimuth
    --------------------------
    ``beta`` is applied to ``modes_a``, which makes the result mildly asymmetric
    under swapping the arguments: measured on SXS:BBH:0201 at
    :math:`\iota = 60^\circ`, 1.87e-3 one way against 1.45e-3 the other.  That
    asymmetry is not an artefact -- an independent reference implementation
    reproduces both numbers -- and it is not really about argument order either.
    Rotating the source by ``beta`` is the same as viewing it from azimuth
    ``beta``, so putting the rotation on ``a`` rather than ``b`` amounts to
    evaluating the pair at a different absolute azimuth, and the mismatch
    genuinely depends on azimuth: the same simulation spans 1.35e-3 to 2.09e-3
    over a uniform azimuth grid, a range that contains both of the numbers
    above.  ``beta`` itself is unaffected, agreeing to 2e-4 rad under a swap.

    Use :func:`compute_strain_mismatch_averaged` when a single
    convention-independent number is wanted; use this function when the
    dependence on viewing geometry is the thing being studied.

    The inner product
    -----------------
    Two-sided, so that it is correct for the *complex* strain and agrees with
    the usual real-signal convention without a case split:

    .. math::

        \langle a | b \rangle = 2 \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}
            \frac{\tilde a(f)\, \tilde b^*(f)}{S_n(|f|)}\, df

    For real :math:`a, b` the negative-frequency half is the conjugate of the
    positive half and this collapses to :math:`4\,\mathrm{Re}\int_0^\infty`.
    Restricting to positive frequencies instead would silently discard the
    counter-rotating content, which is exactly the ``m < 0`` half of the mode
    sum.

    Parameters
    ----------
    modes_a, modes_b : dict
        ``{(ell, em): complex array}``, both sampled at ``delta_t``.  Need not
        be the same length or contain the same modes; only the common ``(l, m)``
        are used.
    delta_t : float
        Sample spacing in seconds.  Must be the same for both.
    inclination, azimuth : float
        Viewing angles in radians.
    psd : pycbc.types.FrequencySeries, optional
        Supply to override ``psd_name``.  Resampled onto the internal grid.
    f_lower, f_upper : float
        Band in Hz.  ``f_upper`` defaults to Nyquist.  Note ``f_lower`` here is
        the *strain* band edge and should be the (2,2) cutoff, not a value
        scaled by ``|m|/2``: the mode-wise scaling in :func:`mode_f_lower`
        exists because each mode is filtered separately, whereas the coherent
        strain carries every mode at once.
    n_beta : int
        Coarse ``beta`` grid size; refined locally afterwards.
    taper_fraction : float
        Start-only taper, as elsewhere in this module.  0 disables.
    symmetrize : bool
        Fill in absent ``m < 0`` modes via :func:`complete_negative_m`.  Leave
        on for non-precessing systems and **off** for precessing ones.

    Returns
    -------
    StrainMatchResult
        Carries ``alpha``, ``beta`` and ``phase_offsets = {m: alpha + m*beta}``
        alongside the match.
